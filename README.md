# Fine-Tuned RoBERTa Model for Paraphrase Detection

### Model Description
This is a fine-tuned version of **RoBERTa-base** for **paraphrase detection**, trained on four benchmark datasets: **MRPC, QQP, PAWS-X, and PIT**. The model is designed for applications like **duplicate content detection, question answering, and semantic similarity analysis**. It demonstrates high performance across varied linguistic structures.

- **Developed by:** Viswadarshan R R  
- **Model Type:** Transformer-based Sentence Pair Classifier  
- **Language:** English  
- **Finetuned from:** `FacebookAI/roberta-base`

### Model Sources

- **Repository:** [Hugging Face Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/viswadarshan06/pd-bert/)  
- **Research Paper:** _Comparative Insights into Modern Architectures for Paraphrase Detection_ (Accepted at ICCIDS 2025)  
- **Demo:** (To be added upon deployment) 

## Uses

### Direct Use
- Identifying **duplicate questions** in FAQs and customer support.  
- Improving **semantic search** in information retrieval systems.  
- Enhancing **document deduplication** and content moderation.

### Downstream Use
The model can be further fine-tuned on domain-specific paraphrase datasets (e.g., medical, legal, or finance).

### Out-of-Scope Use
- The model is not designed for multilingual paraphrase detection since it is trained only on English datasets.
- May not perform well on low-resource languages without additional fine-tuning.

## Bias, Risks, and Limitations

### Known Limitations
- Struggles with idiomatic expressions: The model finds it difficult to detect paraphrases in figurative language.
- Contextual ambiguity: May fail when sentences require deep contextual reasoning.

### Recommendations
Users should fine-tune the model with additional cultural and idiomatic datasets for improved generalization in real-world applications.

## How to Get Started with the Model

To use the model, install **transformers** and load the fine-tuned model as follows:

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification

# Load the tokenizer and model
model_path = "viswadarshan06/pd-robert"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path)
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_path)

# Encode sentence pairs
inputs = tokenizer("The car is fast.", "The vehicle moves quickly.", return_tensors="pt", padding=True, truncation=True)

# Get predictions
outputs = model(**inputs)
logits = outputs.logits
predicted_class = logits.argmax().item()

print("Paraphrase" if predicted_class == 1 else "Not a Paraphrase")
```
